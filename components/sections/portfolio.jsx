                  <p>
                  The ETSU University Web site is maintained by a group of web developers at ETSU of which I am a part of. The website is built on a multi-faceted technology stack 
                  containing full-stack sites. The university site is the main entry point for many current and potential university students throughout Northeast Tennessee Region. 
                  I have developed and assisted in building infrastructure for the back-end along with developing front-facing components and enhancements that are heavily customized 
                  from the baseline CMS implementation.

                    Graduate and Undergraduate students asses the potential costs for items such as housing, meal plans, tuition, financial aid, and payment options 
                    should they choose to attend East Tennessee State University. </p>

                  <p>
                    The ETSU Search application was a rebuild and upgrade of the original ASP.Net application that had to be moved from an older Window&apos;s based server to the university&apos;s 
                    new Linux based server. The application required a refit to also include the ability to not only search for information within the university, but it also required an 
                    addition that allow users to search for faculty, staff and students. The students search was required to be protected from off campus personnel and incorporated an 
                    authentication system to accomplish that goal. The search itself targets internal university resources for users to view, while also including additional information 
                    linked to East Tennessee State University from outside resources. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During this time the university was under going a rebranding initiative, so I was able to use a new responsive graphic template that was created by 
                    my co-workers in the final solution that is now being used.

                  <p>The owners wanted an updated site that was more modern and functional, along with a way to manage the content of the website themselves without having to hire a full-time developer. 
                    The solution we decided upon was a content management system (CMS) with a custom template unique to the clients needs.

                  <p>The site was created for East Tennessee State University as part of my employment as a Programmer/Analyst II within the Office of Information Technology.</p>
                  <p>The site was an original concept that allows users to update and maintain various indexing lists for directories within the campus. These list can be harnessed 
                    as either imbedded tables, or there is a backend API associated to allow customization of the content on various departmental websites. The old method to update 
                    this information required constant updates via SQL scripts to a backend database by personnel within the Information Technology department, by creating this 
                    application it gave the same personnel a quick and efficient interface to enter, update, delete and modify this information. 
                    The university had just undergone rebranding as the project was nearing completion. So, I was able to use a new responsive graphic template created 
                    by my co-workers in the final deliverable.
